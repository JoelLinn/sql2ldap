# üìã sql2ldap üçá

An LDAP server that presents SQL rows as LDAP leafs under a single DN.

## Overview

Many systems (e.g. PBX systems) require read-only access to information through an LDAP interface which is often stored using a relational SQL database.
Imagine you want to find a customers phone number from a dictionary on your desk phone or allow your phone system to do reverse name lookups of callers.
There are multiple ways to tackle this problem:

* Sync entries with a cron job to a traditional LDAP server. This does not scale well.
* Triggers on the SQL database to update the LDAP entries individually.
* Dynamically translate LDAP queries to SQL queries (this tool).

The recently deprecated `back_sql` backend of _OpenLDAP_ also supports the last option.
It is much more versatile (it can store complete trees) but therefore generates strongly fragmented _SQL_ query patterns (i.e. one unique query for each attribute of every result) - even for simple one-table, one-objectClass ,mappings like the ones this tool supports.

## Examples

You can find an examples using docker-compose with a PostgreSQL server [here][examples].

## (Un)supported features

This tool uses [sqlx][sqlx] for database access, which supports a number of SQL databases.
At this time however, only PostgreSQL is implemented here.
Others should be easy to add and I'm happy to accept your contribution!

Currently no TLS or Authentication is implemented. It can be achieved by using _OpenLDAP_ with `back_ldap`.
